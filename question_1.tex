\section{Question}
1. Assess yourself, from 1 to 4, in the following areas or skills. We are not looking for a candidate to have experience with all, or even a majority, of these areas. This question is much less about the magnitude of the numbers and more about their relation â€“ where do you think your strengths are?
\newline
\newline
1 = Very little or no experience
\newline
2 = Some experience, but not yet at a level of full competence and confidence
\newline
3 = A lot of experience, generally able to do this work at a professional level
\newline
4 = Very experienced, typically the expert on my team or among peers
\newline

\hline
	Model Predictive Control & 
	2 &
	--- & 
	I need to put in the time on this one, external support not required. \\
\hline
	Optimal Control & 
	2 & 
	Need to learn more about dynamic programming for dynamic optimization. But I do kalman filters and LQR & 
	--- \\
\hline
	Dynamic systems modeling & 
	4 & 
	ODEs yes. PDEs are within reach & 
	A thermal science expert, to bake what they know into the dynamics \\
\hline
	Microcontrollers & 
	3 & 
	--- & 
	Firmware engineer to own OS/drivers \\
\hline
	Scripting languages & 
	4 & 
	Matlab & 
	--- \\
\hline
	C/C++ & 
	2 & 
	--- & 
	Firmware engineer to fill the gap, though I can (and desperately want to) come up to speed with this. I have in the past done all my work including real-time code in Simulink \\
\hline
	Software version control & 
	2 & 
	I use it regularly & 
	Git Wrangler \\
\hline
	Experimental Design & 1 & I just googled this & --- \\
\hline
	Instrumentation & 
	2 & 
	It's the systems/test engineer that has handled this in my experience, but I can do this. Related skill - I generally pick sensors and decide (with electrical engineer) interfacing with the micro. & 
	I will need to read the manual on thermocouples, anemometers, etc \\
\hline
	Data acquisition (NI or other DAQ) & 
	2 & 
	Same answer as 'Instrumentation' & 
	--- \\

	Heat transfer & 
	3 & 
	I have a working knowledge of heat transfer. I do not get into the depths of calculating convective heat transfer coefficients. 		& 
	Thermal Engineer \\
\hline
	Thermodynamics & 
	3 & 
	Working knowledge, good enough to have a comfortable grasp on refrigeration. & 
	Thermal Engineer \\
