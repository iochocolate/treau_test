\section{Question}
Briefly describe your weakest points in the list above and describe what extra resources
or support could help you interface with these topic areas.

\subsection *{Answer}

I have answered this mostly in question 1, but here are two weaknesses worth dwelling on more:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item MPC: This might be important for your product for interior temperature control, to take advantage of energy storage in building capacitance etc. I understand it but I need to spend some time on this to ensure that I can execute production-grade algos on this. I would need support with procuring some paid toolboxes for this.
  \item C/C++: I should be really good at this already but I have been doing all my professional work in Matlab/Simulink \(\rightarrow\) autocoding. I am very competent in that toolchain, starting from architecting the software for the complete feature set down to creating micro-ready code. So I am not new to coding for real time systems. If you have an engineer that works on C/C++ (firmware engineer?), they can lead this while I come up to speed. In the mean time, I would need you to be okay with me probably introducing some autocoded Simulink so that I can deploy my algos.
\end{enumerate}
