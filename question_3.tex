\section{Question}
Briefly describe your strongest points in the list above and your experience in building
those skills.

\subsection *{Answer}
I have mostly answered this in question 1 but here's some information:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item Controls - I learned by doing. Back in school, I thought I would become a simulation engineer, but I was very interested in understanding how ECUs worked. So I got into it working on a project in school. I have self-learned what I know. Secondly, working on thermal systems for EVs requires architecting logic for multiple interacting loops with multiple heat sources/sinks; I consider it a strength of mine.
   \item Thermal - Same with this, I have learned this myself. I would rate my system-level understanding as very good. I.e. how does everything need to work together. But I would not know how to design an HX.
\end{enumerate}
